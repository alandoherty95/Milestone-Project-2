                <p>Limerick, Ireland’s third largest city, was founded by the Vikings in 812. Limerick is one of Ireland’s oldest cities, with a Charter of Incorporation older than that of London’s, dating back to 1197! It has been a Viking settlement, a medieval walled town, a Georgian city and is now a modern, vibrant metropolitan area with a rich and historic hinterland. </p>
                    
                <p>The Vikings were great traders and craftsmen and Limerick had contacts with other Viking towns all over Europe. St Mary’s Cathedral was founded in the twelfth century and remains the oldest building in Limerick still in use for its original purpose. The Normans captured Limerick in 1195 and left their stamp on the city. King John’s Castle, the walls of Limerick and the local government system they founded, survive to this day. 
                </p>
                <p>In 2021, Limerick has approximately 100,000 people live in the city and suburban areas!</p>

                <p>Limerick is home to the largest Georgian Quarter in Ireland outside Dublin! Limerick’s Georgian Quarter - known as Newtown Pery - was built in the late 18th and early 19th century, to a grid plan of equal rectangular blocks and of a distinctive architectural unity which still defines the city centre to this day. </p>
                    
                <p>Economic decline in the 19th century and subsequent lack of investment, coupled with the trend toward suburban living, left the Georgian Heritage compromised and caused the loss of the character of its historic neighbourhood. Today, over 200 years later, the area is seeing a renaissance as “the Georgian Neighbourhood.
