                <p>King John's Castle is a 13th-century castle located on Kings Island in Limerick, next to the River Shannon. The foundation of the city of Limerick, however, is generally dated to 922, when the Viking leader Thormodu Helgason established a permanent base on Kings Island, this is the area where King John's Castle now stands. It is located at the heart of Limerick’s medieval quarter. The site on which the Castle stands has been occupied for over 1000 years.

                <p>Saint Mary’s Cathedral was founded in 1168 AD and stands majestically over the City of Limerick on the banks of the River Shannon. It is one of the most important medieval buildings to survive intact in Ireland, which is still performing its original function. It is the oldest building in Limerick still in continuous daily use. It is an extraordinary building that has been ever-present during invasions, sieges, battles, wars, famines and times of peace.

                </p>

                <p>The Cathedral of Saint Mary Blessed Virgin has had a long and eventful history. It was founded in 1168 on the site of a palace donated by Donal Mor O'Brien King of Munster. Experts believe that parts of the palace are incorporated into the present structure of the Cathedral.</p>

                <p>The most prominent is the West Door which tradition has it as the main entrance to the palace. The palace had been built on the site of the Viking meeting house. This had been the centre of government in the early medieval Viking city.</p>

                <p>The Cathedral has seen many changes as the city expanded around it and it remains today the oldest and most historic building in Limerick. No trip to the City is complete without visiting this historic building at the very heart of this ancient metropolis.

                <p>The Treaty Stone is a monument with a stone said to be used in the signing of the 1691 Treaty of Limerick, marking the surrender of the city to William of Orange. The Treaty Stone stands across the River Shannon from King John's Castle. Tradition has it the Treaty of Limerick, that ended the Williamite-Jacobite War, was signed on this limestone block, in Limerick City.</p>

                <p>Under the terms, a promise was made to respect Catholicism, but the treaty was rejected by the English and Irish Parliaments and its terms were ignored. Thus Limerick became known as The City of the Broken Treaty.</p>

                <p>The stone rests on a pedestal that was erected in May 1865 by John Rickard Tinslay, mayor of the city. The pedestal is decorated with an image of the castle, on the opposite side of the River Shannon, which is surmounted by a dome and cross, signifying that Limerick was a cathedral city. This symbol is now the civic insignia of Limerick Corporation while the Latin inscription is taken from Virgil's description of Troy.

                <p>Sarsfield Bridge is a five-span limestone road bridge. It was built between 1824-35 connecting Sarsfield Street and Ennis Road. It was once a swivel bridge that could open allowing large vessels to pass into the upper quays. This function is no longer in use although the mechanisms can still be seen under the bridge. 
                </p>
                <p>The westward expansion of Limerick and the growth of its commerce made the Shannon and the improvement of the harbour facilities a vital necessity. The foundation stone was laid on the 25th October 1824 and the bridge was opened 5th August 1835, with a cost of £89,061. The design of the bridge is based on Pont Neuilly which spans the Seine in Paris. Each span reaches 70 feet, with each arch rising to a height of 8 feet 6 inches.
                </p>
                <p>In 1883, the Corporation held a meeting and changed the name of the bridge from Wellesley to Sarsfield. A plaque was erected in the centre of the east parapet giving the new name.
